//! Audio-reactive keyboard lighting ("Audio Sync" in the official Windows app).
//!
//! Confirmed real, from the actual v5.1.526 bundle: `INTERACTIVE_EFFECT`
//! (`main.js`) has named values `sunrex_Rock=3`, `sunrex_Lightning=4`,
//! `sunrex_Xlight=5`, `sunrex_Rain=6`, `sunrex_Digital=7`, `sunrex_Spectrum=8`,
//! `sunrex_Disco=13` - the exact same names reused, unchanged, inside the
//! `Sunrex_Music_2024`/`Sunrex_Music_2025` effect-list constants
//! (`primitive_predator-function.ts.js`) that back the "Audio Sync" UI
//! string (`MUI_Audio_Sync`, `i18n/en.json`: *"The light effects will follow
//! the sound variation during playing games or listening to music"*).
//!
//! **Why this is a from-scratch reimplementation, not a decoded protocol:**
//! the same enum's `sunrex_ScreenSync=9` is independently confirmed
//! (`MAPEAMENTO-PARA-O-APP.md` section 4, re: issue #37's "Screen Mimic") to
//! be a *software* feature - the app captures the screen and streams
//! ordinary color writes, there is no dedicated "screen sync" wire mode.
//! Audio Sync sits in the same enum, named the same way, and reuses the same
//! effect names ("Wave", "Rock", ...) as the already-known `MAG_*` hardware
//! effects - the strong reading is that it works identically: the app reads
//! the live audio level and re-sends ordinary color writes, no dedicated
//! wire mode to reverse-engineer. There is nothing here that traces back to
//! undocumented hardware behavior, so it carries none of the "unconfirmed
//! against real firmware" risk the rest of this session's protocol work did.
//!
//! Capture goes through the system's own `parec` (pulseaudio-utils, or
//! PipeWire's pulse-compatible build - already present on this machine and
//! any standard desktop Linux with audio) rather than a new Rust audio
//! crate dependency, matching how the rest of this project already shells
//! out to system tools (`nvidia-smi`, `systemctl`, ...) instead of adding
//! heavy library dependencies for something the OS already provides.

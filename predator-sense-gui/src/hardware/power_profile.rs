//! Automatic performance profile enforcement based on the power source.
//!
//! When enabled (the "Perfil automático por energia" setting), this is a
//! continuous policy, not just a reaction to plugging/unplugging:
//! - On AC: always Performance or Turbo. If the current profile is already
//!   one of those two, leave it alone - never fight a manual choice between
//!   them. Otherwise (coming from Quiet/Balanced/unknown), move up to the
//!   user-configured AC target.
//! - On battery: always Balanced or Quiet, never Performance/Turbo - moving
//!   fast profiles to battery burns charge and runs hotter than the cooling
//!   budget really allows unplugged. Below 15% battery, Quiet is forced
//!   regardless of the configured target, since that's the one point where
//!   stretching the remaining charge matters more than raw speed.
//!
//! Runs every tick (not just on a source transition) so a battery level
//! crossing the 15% critical line while already unplugged reacts too.

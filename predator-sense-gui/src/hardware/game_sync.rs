//! Per-game automatic profile switching ("GameSync"), the same idea the
//! official Windows app implements via a WMI `Win32_ProcessStartTrace`
//! event and a registered game list (see the reverse-engineering notes this
//! was modeled after). There is no equivalent kernel event hookup here -
//! that would need a netlink proc connector socket, a new privileged
//! failure surface nobody has asked for yet. Instead this piggybacks on the
//! same 5s tick `power_profile::check()` already runs on with a cheap
//! `/proc` scan: a few seconds of latency to notice a game starting is an
//! acceptable trade for not adding a new socket. Only ever calls
//! `profile::set_profile()`, the same entry point every other profile
//! switch in this app already goes through - no new hardware-write path.
